<P><h2>My name is Sristi Paul, and I’m currently pursuing my MCA. I’ve always been passionate about technology, especially web and software development, and I see myself growing into a professional who can contribute meaningfully to the IT industry while also enjoying the process of learning and problem-solving.

One of my biggest plus points is that I’m curious and open-minded — I love exploring new ideas, talking to people, and understanding different perspectives. I’m also dedicated once I set my mind to something, and I try to balance ambition with a calm and peaceful outlook on life. On the other hand, I sometimes doubt myself too much, and I can be overly emotional or talkative when I should be quiet. But I’m actively working on being more composed, private, and confident in my own decisions.

My hobbies include reading books, especially romcoms, enjoying peaceful moments near the beach, dancing, and learning new skills that align with my career goals. I also like spending time alone, which helps me reflect and recharge.

In the professional field, I see myself as someone who is hardworking, adaptable, and passionate about continuous growth. I want to build a career in software development and eventually achieve a lifestyle where I’m independent, confident, and at peace with both my work and personal life.</h2></P>
